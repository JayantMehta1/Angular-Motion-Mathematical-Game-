# Angular-Motion-Mathematical-Game
Developed a game in Java in the Processing IDE. The game has multiple levels and the goal is to get passed all security barriers to get to the next level.

These include guards, moving guards, lasers, etc.

I also developed some basic AI such that the guards detect where the player is and point the lasers in that direction. This is in the upper levels with increased difficulty.

The game is developed using classes, inherited classes, and I also worked with the lasers in radians using the arctan function. The game helped me develop a stronger understanding of object-oriented programming and allowed me to be creative in designing different levels with basic AI.
